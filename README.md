# Revenue Optimization for Transport Services

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes payment behavior across **6M+ taxi trips** to identify key revenue drivers in transport services. The objective is to evaluate whether payment methods influence fare amounts and provide data-driven strategies to improve overall revenue.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- Hypothesis Testing
- A/B Testing
- Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains detailed taxi trip records including fare amount, payment type, trip distance, and ride duration, enabling large-scale statistical analysis.

## 🔍 Methodology
- Cleaned and processed a dataset of over 6 million records.
- Segmented trips based on payment method (Credit Card vs Cash).
- Conducted **A/B Testing** and **Two-Sample T-tests** to test the hypothesis that credit card payments yield higher fares.
- Validated statistical significance of observed differences.

## 📈 Key Findings
- Credit card payments showed a statistically significant higher average fare compared to cash.
- Payment method emerged as a strong contributor to revenue variation.
- Results were consistent across multiple trip segments.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Promote digital and card-based payments through driver and rider incentives.
- Design targeted incentive programs for drivers to encourage non-cash payments.
- Optimize payment strategies to improve revenue efficiency.

## 🚀 Outcome
The analysis indicates a **potential revenue uplift of up to 15%** through optimized payment and incentive strategies, supported by statistically validated results.
